# plennarylitics
A full-stack application to analyse plannary sessions in the German Bundestag using Svelte(Kit), FastAPI and ElasticSearch

# Data Processing

* Establish a connection to the Bundestag APi and request an API token
* Try pulling relevant data from this api 
* Extract data about missing MPs from the XML Files
* Extract data about comments and other reactions from the plenary from the XML files
* Split the XML files in a way, that enables easy querying in elasticseach

## Frontend
* Get a basic frontend structure up and running
* Make routing between different pages possible and set up the frontend in a way, that makes the display of our data structures easier
* Read about FastAPI and get an early state of the connection running

## Backend

* Install elasticsearch and get it running
* Import first data from the Budnestag API in elasticsearch
* Connect elasticsearch to the preprocessign pipeline
* Load the split documents into elasticsearch
* Load the data about missing MPs in elasticseach
 

## Timeline for the second part of the project:

* Final implementation of the frontend and addition of visuals
* Connection to the backend and exchange of data with the frontend


## Week 44/45

* Setting up project proposal
  * defining goal
  * defining work packages
  * defining work distribution / member roles
